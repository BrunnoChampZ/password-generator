This is a simple Python program that generates random passwords based on user preferences. It allows you to specify the number of letters, numbers, and symbols you want in your password.

## How to Use

1. Run the program by executing it in your Python environment.

2. You will be prompted to enter the following:
   - Number of Letters: How many letters you want in your password.
   - Number of Numbers: How many numbers you want in your password.
   - Number of Symbols: How many symbols you want in your password.

## Code Explanation

The program uses lists of letters, numbers, and symbols to create a pool of characters for generating passwords. It then randomly selects characters from these lists according to your preferences and assembles them into a password. Finally, it shuffles the characters to make the password even more secure.
